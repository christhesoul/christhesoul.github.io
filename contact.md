You can email christhesoul at gmail dot com although I make no guarantees about response times.

I follow lots of fascinating people on Twitter, so whilst I don't tweet often from @christhesoul, I spend a decent amount of time on the platform.

Or you can go the LinkedIn route, but you may get lost in the endless spam I get from recruiters and biz dev people wanting me to use their development agency.
