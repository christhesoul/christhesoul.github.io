If you read something you enjoyed, that helped you in some way, I'd love to hear from you.

Or if you'd like to point out any typos or logic failings, then I'd appreciate that too. (Feel free to [open a pull request](https://github.com/christhesoul/christhesoul.github.io) if you're comfortable doing that.)

You can email christhesoul at gmail dot com.

Alternatively, if you do Twitter, do it [@christhesoul](https://twitter.com/christhesoul). I don't tweet often, but I follow lots of fascinating people, so I spend a decent amount of time on the platform.

Or you can go the LinkedIn route, but you may get lost in the endless spam I get from recruiters and biz dev people wanting me to use their development agency.
