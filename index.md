The above is a Kent Beck quote that continues to resonate.

Web-based software products (my career and continued fascination) change all the time. Partly because they can, and mostly because life happens to the businesses that build them: new customers, technology, regulations, and trends â€“ all bringing their own picnic of demands, quirks, and problems.

But before you make changes, you've got to understand how the code is executing right now.

# Bad code makes you feel like you need to understand everything to understand anything.

(That's a Sandi Metz quote. She's the finest teacher I've ever had. Thanks Youtube.)

Programmers spend more time reading code than writing code. So it's critical that the code we write is easy to read.
