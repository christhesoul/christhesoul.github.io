title: What works looks like

:eyes:

I don't have the book to hand right I'm now, but I know there's a section of
[Are Your Lights On](https://leanpub.com/areyourlightson) that states:

> The solution to your current problem is simply the cause of the next.

Or words to that effect.

And navigating from problem to problem – or on a good day avoiding every next problem due to clever use of one's melon – is what I like to call _work_.

Some people, of course, know every programming language, framework, tool, architectural paradigm and refactoring technique that's ever been invented. But ordinary folks like you and me don't.

So we have to go through The Struggle.

And that's cool. Because one day _we didn't even know the stuff we know now_.<sup>1</sup>

Sometimes we can stick bits of existing knowledge together with a few Google searches and a spoonful of Stack Overflow copypasta.

But then sometimes you're faced with something really new.

And that collides with something else that you don't have much experience in.

All of a sudden it just feels overwhelming.

Like _really_ overwhelming.

Imposter syndrome kicks in.

You know plenty of things about software engineering, but all of sudden start to feel like you don't really know that you know them at all.

(If the above resonates, please watch the first three minutes of [this talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/ideology) by the brilliant Gary Bernhardt where he talks about Donald Rumsfeld's _known knowns_ speech.)

And so sometimes your entire day's work is going to look like this.

And even this has a ridiculous Disney-esque happy ending to give you an unhealthy does of misplaced optimism. Because some days you won't even get that satisfying green tick at the end of the day indicating the code has successfully run every step in your CI build.

Some days you just fail.

And that's okay. Failing is the act of not succeeding in what you're trying to achieve.

Which actually sounds pretty positive, in a strange way.

Not succeeding in what you're trying to achieve means that

1. You're trying, and not quitting.
2. You're trying to achieve something – instead of sitting on your backside with a caramel-infused chocolate bar waiting for Success to knock on your door.

And yes, right this minute, you just really want _something to fucking work_.

But getting stuck _is the work_.

Staring out the window as you mentally execute your code _is the work_.

Talking to a duck _is the work_.

Explaining your problem to somebody else in the hope they can help _is the work_.

Pushing a PR that you know will fail so somebody can take a fresh look _is the work_.

Going for a walk to stop yourself going insane _is the work_.

Doing a seemingly insignificant ticket just to get your confidence back _is the work_.

Watching a conference talk on YouTube that might be mildly related to your problem _is the work_.
